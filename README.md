# 23viewer

23 viewer should become an Android app for the 23 photo community. 

At the moment the app is only a prototype. You can authorize the app against your 23 account and download one image from my personal 23 page. The image and the description should be displayed, that's it at the moment. Nothing more.

I will add new features (better design, full support of all functionality of 23, ...) in the future. This is a work in progress.

I have nothing to do with the company behind 23 and I'm not an employee of them. I do this app in my spare time, mostly to learn to code on Android with C#.
