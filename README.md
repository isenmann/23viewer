# 23viewer

23 viewer should become an Android app for the 23 photo community. 

At the moment the app is only a prototype. You can authorize the app against your 23 account and download one image from my personal 23 page. The image and the description should be displayed, that's it at the moment. Nothing more.

I will add new features (better design, full support of all functionality of 23, ...) in the future. This is a work in progress.

I have nothing to do with the company behind 23 and I'm not an employee of them. I do this app in my spare time, mostly to learn to code on Android with C#.

## Screenshots

These two screenshots just show the work in progress. The navigation with its three swipable tabs are ready, the card with the image is the first shot to display an image from 23. This card will be look much better in the future with a lot more information and also lots of more cards should be displayed. Expect changes to these anytime, I will update the screenshots as soon as I have new functionality implemented.
