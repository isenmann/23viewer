# 23viewer

23 viewer should become an Android app for the 23 photo community. 

At the moment the app is only a prototype. You can authorize the app against your 23 account and download one image from my personal 23 page. The image and the description should be displayed, that's it at the moment. Nothing more.

I will add new features (better design, full support of all functionality of 23, ...) in the future. This is a work in progress.

I have nothing to do with the company behind 23 and I'm not an employee of them. I do this app in my spare time, mostly to learn to code on Android with C#.

## Screenshots

These two screenshots just show the work in progress. The navigation with its three swipable tabs are ready, the card with the image is just a first shot to display an image from 23 and its title. This card will be look much better in the future with a lot more information and of course also lots of more cards should be displayed from your stream, contacts, etc. This was only a first shot to display some data. Expect changes to these anytime, I will update the screenshots as soon as I have new functionality implemented.

A few words to the navigation at the top. The tab with the home icon should display all new photos from your contacts and will become an endless scrolling list. The tab with the search icon will have two tasks, the first one will be to search 23 (at least what is possible) and second task will be to show the last recent uploads or "Interesting photos" of 23. The last tab will be your profile, with your photos and albums, your buddy icon, your contacts displayed with buddy icons, etc. 

If these features are implemented, I will start to implement the upload feature. This will include uploading photos from your smartphone directly to 23, no matter if they are in the gallery or directly from your smartphone camera.
